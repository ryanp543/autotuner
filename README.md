# RaPID Tuning Procedure

## Flexible-Base Manipulator Control Autotuner

Welcome to the RaPID (Rapid PID) Tuning Procedure! These scripts allow one to take a Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) file as well as matrices describing the passive suspension as inputs and then generates PID gains that guarantee stability for robotic arms mounted on flexible bases. 

The files provided in this repository are intended to be placed into a ROS package if you are using Gazebo to run simulations, as the provided example does. However, if you only desire to generate the PID gains and/or optimize a trajectory, feel free to just run the Python files in the `/script/TrajectoryPlanner` directory according to the steps below. Otherwise, make sure to create a catkin package in your `src` file, delete the default `package.xml` and `CMakeLists.txt` files, and clone this repository into your package folder (and run `catkin_make` or `catkin build`, of course).

## Requirements

All Python files should be executed with Python 2. Development of this library was done on an Ubuntu 18.04.5 operating system.

## Autotuner Inputs

The inputs into the autotuner is a `.urdf` file and a Python file containing the stiffness and damping matrices of the suspension. In this example, the `.urdf` file was created using a [Solidworks to URDF exporter](http://wiki.ros.org/sw_urdf_exporter) for the main body and arm (excluding the "legs" of the suspension). The "legs" of the suspension are added separately to the `.urdf` file. For an example, see the `robot_controlsim_v3.urdf` file in the `urdf` folder.

The stiffness and damping matrix equations of the suspension were formulated using [Motion Genesis](http://www.motiongenesis.com/) and then written into a Python file. Nonlinearities were replaced with Taylor Series equivalents. 

## Generating PID Gains

First steps:

1. Download [Klamp't](https://github.com/krishauser/Klampt) (Build from source if `pip install` doesn't work. Follow online instructions.)
2. Convert `.xacro` to `.urdf` if the file is not already. There have been issues with having `.STL` files under the visual geometry tag, so try to avoid adding STLs. 
3. Edit `robot_sim.xml` in `/script/TrajectoryPlanner` such that "file=" points to your `.urdf` file
4. Run `GenerateConstants.py` to generate `.csv` file with constants

Repeat Step 5-8 until desired stability regions are achieved

5. Adjust alpha and K_I in the `.csv` file (under "Adjustable Parameters") as desired
6. Run `GenerateGains.py` to generate PID bounds based on alpha and K_I
7. Set desired "Selected PID Gains" in the `.csv` file as desired based on the bounds generated by `GenerateGains.py`
8. Run `GeneratePlots.py` to view stability region plots and lower bounds on selected alpha/KI

Note: Running `GenerateGainBounds.py` with the `GenerateGainsConstants.csv` open will change values in the `.csv`, but you will not see them right away. To see the changes made to the `.csv` file, close and then reopen the `GenerateGainsConstants.csv`.

## Trajectory Planner Optimizer

The trajectory optimizer class can be found in the `planner_3D_scipy.py` of the `/script/TrajectoryPlanner` directory. The class and its functions can be imported into any desired Python file. An example of how to use the class can be seen in the main function of `planner_3D_scipy.py`.

For the provided example:

1. If using trajectory planner, run `planner_3D_scipy.py` from the `/script/TrajectoryPlanner` directory after setting final arm orientations in the main function
2. This generates a trajectory plan in `planned_trajectory.csv` that can be used when running Gazebo simulations. 
3. An example of using this `.csv` file for Gazebo simulations can be seen in `run_simulation_2.py` in the `script` directory.

## Provided Simulation Example

In the outermost package directory, there are several folders involved in the simulation. The `meshes` folder contains all the `.STL` files of the Bioinstrumentation Lab agricultural robot prototype, Rover II. The `src` folder contains C++ plugins for the Gazebo simulation. The other folders are relatively self-explanatory--`config` contains a `.yaml` file to change the PID gains of the ROS joint controllers, `launch` contains ROS launch files, and `urdf` contains `.xacro` description files of Rover II.

The provided example (the Python files in the `script` directory) is specific to Rover II. The three clients were used for debugging purposes and Gazebo simulations. The other files are for running Gazebo simulations after spawning the world and then spawning the robot via `roslaunch autotuner spawn.launch`. 

The first, `run_simulation_1.py`, sends single final state commands for 36 different orientations to the robotic arm, records the joint data over time, and outputs `.csv` files for plotting. The second, `run_simulation_2.py`, takes the series of position commands generated by the trajectory optimizer for the 36 orientations (which, in this case, is stored in `planned_trajectory3.csv`), sends them to the robotic arm, records the joint data over time, and outputs `.csv` files. The final two plotting files, `plot_simulation_data.py` and `plot_tracking_error.py`, take those `.csv` files and outputs plots for the simulations. 

To run these simulations, three terminal shells are needed: one to `roslaunch` the gazebo world, one to `roslaunch autotuner spawn.launch`, and one to `rosrun autotuner run_simulation_1.py` or `rosrun autotuner run_simulation_2.py`. Make sure to source your bash file and call all ROS commands from your catkin workspace directory, not the package directory. 

#### Note on Using Tuned PID Gains

In this example, [ros_control](http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control) is used to control the simulated rover and robotic arm. Specifically, each joint is monitored by an effort controller in the `config` directory. The PID gains generated by the autotuner are inputted into the `joints.yaml` file for the robotic arm joints. Note that Joint 4 is the stepper motor wrist and thus does not require PID inputs.
