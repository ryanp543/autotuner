Steps:

1. Download Klampt (Build from source if pip install doesn't work! Follow online instructions.)
2. Convert xacro to urdf if the file is not urdf already.
3. Run GenerateConstants.py to generate .csv file with constants

Repeat Step 4-7 until desired stability regions are achieved

4. Adjust alpha and K_I (under "Adjustable Parameters") as desired
5. Run GenerateGains.py to generate PID bounds based on alpha and K_I
6. Set desired "Selected PID Gains" in .csv file as desired based on the bounds generated by GenerateGains.py
7. Run GeneratePlots.py to view stability region plots and lower bounds on selected alpha/KI

Note: Running GenerateGainBounds.py with the GenerateGainsConstants.csv open will change values in the .csv, but you will not see them right away. To see the changes made to the .csv file, close and then reopen the GenerateGainsConstants.csv

Currently for 3DOF arms:

8. If using trajectory planner, run planner_3D_scipy.py from the Trajectory Planner directory after setting final arm orientations in the main function
9. This generates a trajectory plan in planned_trajectory.csv that can be used when running Gazebo simulations. 
10. An example of using this .csv file for Gazebo simulations can be seen in run_simulation2.py in the "script" directory.
